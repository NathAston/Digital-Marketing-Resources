	</ul>
	
	<h2>Growing Instagram Followers</h2>
	<h4>Follow / Unfollow Method</h4>
	<p>Probably the most common method I see for people growing followers on Instagram is the follow unfollow method. I will be completely open and honest, short term - yes, this method does work you will see consistent follower growth (I grew my personal Instagram to 45,000+ followers using this) however, long term you are doing more harm than good. You will see your engagement drop off, Instagram will not promote your posts and in all honesty it's not worth doing. Instagram is investing heavily in fighting these actions, the algorithms are extremely efficent in picking up trends of someone using the follow unfollow method. Most likely, you will not be banned (most people believe they haven't been caught as their account hasn't been banned). But you will see your engagement drop tremendously as instagram slowly phases out your accounts reach, which defeats the whole purpose of growing followers in the first place. </p><p>If you are going to use this method, I would create multiple "slave accounts" to perform the follow/unfollow actions and send automated direct messages inviting people to follow your main account. This way the Instagram algorithms won't pick up on your main account as it's not performing any of the marketing activity itself, and to be caught doing this </p>
	
	<h4>Loop Giveaways</h4>
	<p>This is quite an interesting way to go, and considering you can buy in for $40 and gain up to 5000 real followers, it's not too bad of an investment. The downfall is most of thes people are just following you as they want to win the giveaway prize, not necessarily because they like your content which in the long run could harm your engagement. </p>
	
	<h4> Buying Shoutouts</h4>
	
	<h4> Host a giveaway </h4>
	<p> If you already have a large eMail list or following elsewhere why not promote a giveaway? Tell your audience to follow you on Instagram and send them an Auto DM with a number, then host on Instagram live stream to further engage with your audience and pull a number out a hat to choose the winner. </p>
	
	<h4> Hire promoters</h4>
	<p> This may seem expensive, but this can be incredibly cheap promotion. A fashion bran I saw previously made a post saying "Hiring promoters, receive free clothes for one year when you promote for us" Repost this using #XYZ to enter and we'll pick 5 winners. The comapny went viral almost overnight with girls jumping at the chance to work as a model. </p>
	
	<h4> Promote on your site </h4>
    <h4> Share your Instagram Content elsewhere</h4>
	<p> I still find it hard to believe, but most people simply stick to Instagram to grow their Instagram profile. But you can easily market your Instagram across so many different channels, upload your photos to 500px, Unsplash, Share on Pinterest, Share in Instagram Reddit forums to push traffic towards your Instagram and help get discovered. You can also embed your posts in your blog/website to promote your Instagram like this. </p>
	<h4>How to grow an Instagram Account</h4>
	<p>Now, lets talk about the correct, legitimate way to grow a following on Instagram. </p>
	<h3> Is your brand suitable for Instagram</h3>
	<p>This is a question you should be asking yourself from the first stages, by all means you should create a profile and have some presence on Instagram. But before you invest a lot of time and energy into marketing on Instagram, you may want to ask yourselves these questions - if your brand doesn't quite match up, you may find your time is better invested on other Social Platforms such as LinkedIn</p>
<label class="container">
  <input type="checkbox">
  <span class="checkmark"><strong>Can you create beautiful visual content consistently?</strong></span>
</label>
   <p>This really comes down to your niche/brand, if you are in fashion and are reguarly doing photoshoots or another creative Industry Instagram is going to be the perfect platform for you to market your brand. </p>
   <p>If you aren't able to do this, you could look at more creative visuals such as motiviational images, quotes or copyright free photography (Unsplash is a great source for this, you could easily grow a very high-quality Instagram from their content alone)</p>
   <p>If you aren't sure what to post, look for influencers within your niche and research your competitiors to see what type of content they are posting, look at the likes/comments on the posts to see which performs best and use this as inspiration. </p>
	<br>

	
	
	<h3>Engaging with users </h3>
	<p>Whilst I have expressed my feelings towards the follow/unfollow method, the principle behind the method is very effective. Which is simply engaging with users in your target market in a hope they will follow you back, this is very effective and is the best way to grow your audience, particuarly at early stages.</p>
	<p>Find popular hashtags withing your niche, for exmaple if I was looking to grow Notifia's users via Instagram I would use #growthhacking, and go an like and comment on any users posts matching this. You can set up Automation tools to do this if you wish.</p>
	<h3>Using Hashtags Effectively</h3>
	<p>Use Hashtags with 500,000-1M Posts that are related to your niche, these are popular enough to get noticed, but not too large that you'll get drowned out within a second by the competition. </p>
    <h3>Improving Engagement</h3>
	<p>At this present time, the Instagram algorithms major ranking factor is engagement. Every time you post, your goal is to get as many users to like, comment and click on your post as possible, this delivers postivie signals to the algorithm and maximises your chances of ranking your post.</p>
	<p>Instruct your users - I'm sure you've seen posts go viral that say "tag 3 friends" or "double tap if you agree" that's because these posts are prompting users to engage, and they are surprisingly effective. </p>
	<h3>Creating Content</h3>
	<p> be sure to make use of instagrams latest features whenever they release one, carousel images, Instagram Stories and live video all perform extremely well and are naturally promoted by instagram. If you are trying ot grow a local audience, Stories work especially well for this. </p>
	<h3>Engagement Groups</h3>
	<h3>Automated Posting</h3>
	
	<h3>Instagram Account Health</h3>
	<p>Instagram Gives your account a health rating, this directly effects if Instagram promotes your content. your health rating is decided by a number of factors</p>
	<ul>
	<li> Engagement on posts</li>
	<li> Using Automation Tools</li>
	<li> Posting Consistency </li>
	<li> Reported for spam/inappropriate content</li>
	<li> CTR on your posts</li>
	
	
	</ul>
	<h3>Buying Instagram Accounts</h3>
	<p> Whilst previously this was something I was totally against, recently I've been becoming more and more open to it. with recent changes to the instagram algorithm around automated following, It's becoming more and more appealing to simply buy an Instgram acocunt from an influencer. But before buying I woul make sure that the ccount has not been growing via the follow unfollow method as this defeats the whole purpose. For anyone stuck on a business idea and looking to make some quick cash, selling Instagram accounts that have been grown to around 10-15k followers is an easy moneymake. people tend to apy $10/1k followers, and if you use software such as massplanner, you could grow 500 accounts at a time (lets say 150 followrs grow on each account per day) that's 75,000 followers grown per day / $750 profit per day if you can continuously find buyers for the accounts. If you can't just keep growing them. This is very blackhat, but you can evne market your own products whilst initially growing the accounts, if you don't have a product to sell set up affiliate links in the account niches. The easiest type of account to grow is one involving women, I previously owned a bikini company and grw that to 14k followers in around 3 weeks with minimal effort. </p>
	<h3>Instagram Rewards Consistency</h3>
	<p>Set a post schedule and post consistently on Instagram, but don't spam. DO NOT POST FOR THE SAKE OF POSTING, as always - a post with low engagement is going to do more harm thatn good. </p>
	
	<h3>Engaging Captions</h3>
	
	<h3>High quality Graphics/Images</h3>
	<p>This should be obvious, but still to this day I'm shocked by people posting low quality images. Instagram is a visual platform, the very 1st rule is to use high-quality content, if it's not high-quality don't upload it. You'll cause more harm than good. </p>
	<h3>Consisten Style/Theme to your page (think of this as building a brand)</h3>
	
	<h3> Powerlikes</h3>
	<p> Very powerful method to go viral when used correctly. We are basically finding influencers in our niche to like our posts, this will then be displayed to their followers in the explore page. </p>
	
	<h3> Use Instagram to deliver BTS content</h3>
	<h3> Videos, Stories, Instagram Live all perform very well</h3>
	<h3>stealing competitors customers</h3>
	<p>Probably my favorite thing to do on Instagram! Simply look up your competitors Instagram profile, click on their followers and you can gaurantee all of these users are either customers of your competitor, interested in what your competitor have to offer or involved in your industry in some way making them well worth engaging with.</p>
	<p>For this you could use Automated software or do it manually depending how many followers they have. for Maximium follow back ratio you should follow and like 5 posts. Don't send any direct messages aunless they follow you back as it doesn't reach the users inbox directly unless they follow you and appears spammy to the algorithm, espcially sending the same message repetitively. </p>
	
	<h3> Best time to post</h3>
	<p> If only I had $1 for everytime I heard this! The answer is it depends on your audience! If your audience is based in London, UK it's no good posting at 7pm San Francisco time as your audience is going to be asleep. Sync your FaceBook page with your Instagram to get business analytics enabled and you can view the times your audience is most active form your Instagram. tests posting around these times and see what works best for you! </p>
	
	<h3>Considering sponsoring an influencer</h3>
	<p>a more and more increasingly popular method to grow! When I say this I don't mean sponsoring @rihianna, just look for influencers in your niche with 20k-50k followers as they will be cheaper and if they are involved in your niche they are often open to working on affiliate basis or in return for a free product. </p>
	<h3> Converting on Instagram</h3>
	<p>Rather than selling direcrly on Instagram, I would actually reccomend using an optu-in method to collect users email and continue to market to the customer from there. </p>
	
	<h3> Monetising your audinece</h3>
