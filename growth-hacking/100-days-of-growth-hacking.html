  <h1>100 Days of Growth Hacking</h1>
  <p>Here is my Ultimate Collection of Growth Hacks that I would use to launch a business. I have grown a company from $0-79,000 revenue per month in under 90 days using these methods. </p>

  <h2 id="account">Your Growth Hacking Checklist</h2>

  <p>Over the next 100 days, we will be covering 3 main areas of the Growth Hacking Process. Acquisition, Optimisation and Scaling. To begin with, our sole focus will be to acquire as many users to your site as possible so we can begin to optimise your site and acquisition process, then scale the best performing methods to maximise your growth. </p>

  <dl class="checklist">
    <dt id="account-2fa"><label><input type="checkbox" name="checklist-2fa" value="checklist-2fa">Day 1: Quora Growth Hack</label></dt>
    <dd>
      
		<p>Perform the Quora Growth Hack <a href="https://support.stripe.com/questions/how-do-i-enable-two-step-verification"></a></p>
      <p>We want to perform Growth Hacks such as this as soon as possible, this isn't going to cause explosive Growth, but it will consistently deliver a steady stream of traffic and conversions to your site. </p>
	  <p>In a previous company I was receiving 2 $39 conversions every day from a single Quora answer, that's $28,000 per year and seeing as this was a recurring subsciption business with my customers average LTV at $400, it works out at the equivalent to $280,000+ in revenue from 1 Quora Answer!</p>
	  <p>Everytime you perform this Growth Hack, I suggest Answering 30-50 niche related questions, and you have to ensure your are delivering value in your answer. Don't just spam your website (quora users hate this). If you get upvoted on several high-traffic Quora questions, your are sitting on a goldmine of niche targeted website visitors. </p>
    </dd>

    <dt id="account-public-info"><label><input type="checkbox" name="checklist-public-info" value="checklist-public-info">Day 2: Reddit Growth Hack</label></dt>
    <dd>
      
      <p>Perform the Reddit Growth Hack<a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/account"></a>
	 </p>
      <p>Once again, an absolute Goldmine for traffic. I've growh a business to six figures in revene from Reddit alone. </p>
      <p>Similar approach to Quora, find reddit threads where users are asking for a tool similar to yours and promote your product or answer their question by saying your product can solve this issue for them.</p>
	  <p>Think of a good DJ on a night out, they don't spend the entire 1 hour set, but they will play a few of their songs and naturally mix it into their mix. In this case you need to be a content DJ, naturally mix links to your site into your content in a non-salesy way - it's a lot harder than it sounds :) </p>
	  <p>Try to get your product to the most upvoted answer and you'll see consistent streams of traffic and conversions. </p>
	  <p>TIP: After 6 months, Reddit posts are Archived and nobody is able to leave further comments, so try to have the most upvoted comment prior to the post turning 6 months old and your comment will remain #1 forver. </p>

    <dt id="account-email"><label><input type="checkbox" name="checklist-email" value="checklist-email">Day 3: Create 5 YouTube Videos</label></dt>
    <dd>


    <p>Create 5 YouTube Videos <a href="https://support.stripe.com/questions/payment-email-notifications"></a></p><p>These should be targeted to your niche and once again trying to help your target audience by delivering value to them. For example, I may create a video on how to create website conversions and promote Notifia in the process, but I'm not creating a sales pitch.</p>
	<p>Nobody likes the feeling of being sold to, and if you can teach your users how you deliver value to them they are far more likely to convert. </p>

    <dd>
		<p><a href="https://try.alexa.com/marketing-stack/keyword-difficulty-tool"></a>So getting started with SEO, I'm going to be honest SEO is a long game and takes months to see some results, which is why we need to start sooner rather than later.</p>
		<p>Alexa is a SEO tool by Amazon, that will give you a lit of easy to rank for Keywords that are targeted specifically to your site. You can get a 7-day Free Trial, take all the keywords and cancel the account straight after.</p>
		<p>Add the keywords to a Google Sheets file, and find the keywords that you wish to rank for the most and compile these into a folder. These are the specific keywords that we are going to target. </p>

    <dd>
      
      <p>Lets write a super high-quality Blog Post around your target Keyword, the post should be around 2000 words of valuable content, include images, infographics and a video if possible (you can just embed from YouTube)</p>
	  <p>Once the post has been completed, you need to start sharing: here's a list of some of my favourite places to share content</p>

    <dd>
      <p>Here I have compiled a list of 250+ places to list your startup to gain initial traction. This is very repetitive task, but 100% worth doing. I would suggest hiring a VA to complete the task. It's also worth noting, many of these sites are specifically tailored to my niche, so you may wish to filter some out/look for alternatives that are more relevent to your industry. </p>

    <dt id="integration-test"><label><input type="checkbox" name="checklist-test" value="checklist-test">Day 7: Create a Chrome Extension</label></dt>
<p>This is a great way to get users quickly, particuarly if it's a tool that's searched for regaurly on the chrome store. It's fairly easy to achieve 50+ installations per day from this. </p>
<p>You have 2 options here, either hire a developer to build a valid Google Chrome Extension that atually delivers value and is directly integrated to your app. This should cost say $300 max. Alternatively, you can build a Chrome Extension that simply redirects to your own website (so when a user clicks it they will be redirected to your site). I have done this previously and still received about 5000 installs before Google took the app down. </p>

    <dt id="integration-errors"><label><input type="checkbox" name="checklist-errors" value="checklist-errors">Day 8: Launch on Product Hunt</label></dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Once you've gone live is an unfortunate time to discover you've not properly written your code to handle every possible <a href="api.html#errors">error type</a>, including those that should &quot;never&quot; happen. Be certain your code is defensive, handling not just the common errors, but all possibilities.</p>
      <p>When testing your error handling, especially watch what information is shown to your users. A card being declined (i.e., a <code>card_error</code>) is a different concern than an error on your backend (e.g., an <code>invalid_request_error</code>).</p>
    </dd>

    <dt id="integration-logging"><label><input type="checkbox" name="checklist-logging" value="checklist-logging">Day 9: Create 5 more YouTube Videos</label></dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Stripe logs every request made with your API keys, with these records being viewable in the <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/logs">Dashboard</a>. We recommend that you log all important data on your end, too, despite the apparent redundancy. Your own logs will be a life-saver if your server has a problem contacting Stripe or there's an issue with your API keys&mdash;both cases would prevent us from logging your request.</p>
      <p>Regularly examine your logs to ensure they're storing all the information you may need and they aren't storing anything of a sensitive nature (e.g., credit card details or personally identifiable information).</p>
    </dd>

    <dt id="integration-objects"><label><input type="checkbox" name="checklist-objects" value="checklist-objects">Day 10: Share YouTube Videos on Reddit</label></dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Stripe objects created in test mode&mdash;such as plans, coupons, products, and SKUs&mdash;are not usable in live mode. This prevents your test data from being inadvertently used in your production code. When recreating necessary objects in live mode, be certain to use the same ID values (e.g., the same plan <em>ID</em>, not the same <em>name</em>) to guarantee your code will continue to work without issue.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt id="integration-webhooks"><label><input type="checkbox" name="checklist-webhooks" value="checklist-webhooks">Day 11: Comment on YouTube Videos</label></dt>
    <p>A great way to raise awareness of your product is just to comment on niche related YouTube videos. Don't go around directly seeling your product, just simply talk and interact with users who are in your niche. People are very nosey, and you'll be surprised the number of clicks you receive on your channel simply from commenting on videos.</p>
	<p>Blackhat: You can buy Youtube comment upvotes if you want your comments to be seen although this is direct breach of Youtube ToS. I have done this previously to test results, I was posting comments on "Despacito" when it was receiving around 500,000 views per minute and getting them upvoted to the top position. This was simpyl an experiment, I did gain around 600 followers from doing so, but Youtube has great algorithms which start to flag your comments. </p>

    <dt id="integration-mailing-list"><label><input type="checkbox" name="checklist-mailing-list" value="checklist-mailing-list">Day 12: Set up Google Adwords</label></dt>
    <p>Adwords is an awesome tool. As much as I prefer creative marketing and growth strategies, I simply cannot deny the benefits of Adwords. It's fairly simple to run a succesful campaign but can be a bit overwhe</p>
